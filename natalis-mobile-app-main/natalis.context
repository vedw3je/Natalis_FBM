## 🌍 **Project Overview**

**Title:** Natalis – Prenatal Imaging Interpretation System
**Team:** Ved Waje, Abhirat More, Pranita Bannore, Harshita Lohana
**Mentor:** Mrs. Vidya Zope
**Institution:** Vivekanand Education Society’s Institute of Technology (VESIT)
**Department:** Computer Engineering
**Academic Year:** 2025–26, Semester VII

### **Objective**

Natalis aims to **democratize prenatal ultrasound screening** by using **AI-powered image interpretation** on a **smartphone-based offline platform**. It bridges the maternal health gap in **low-resource regions**, where limited equipment, lack of skilled sonographers, and unreliable power or internet contribute to preventable maternal and neonatal deaths.

---

## 🩺 **Background and Motivation**

In 2017, approximately **295,000 women died from preventable pregnancy-related causes**, with **99% in low-income countries**. Timely **ultrasound screening** could prevent many of these deaths by identifying complications like:

* **Placenta previa**
* **Multiple gestations**
* **Fetal growth restriction**
* **Preeclampsia**

The **World Health Organization (WHO)** recommends **at least one ultrasound scan before 24 weeks of gestation**, but up to **50% of women in developing countries never receive one** due to a lack of affordable, accessible, and interpretable ultrasound options.

Existing solutions like **BabyChecker** and **DeepEcho** show that AI can empower minimally trained health workers to perform ultrasound scans using smartphone guidance. However, these systems remain limited by dependency on connectivity, expensive hardware, or region-specific datasets.

---

## ⚙️ **Problem Statement**

Maternal and neonatal deaths persist because:

1. **Access Gaps:** Lack of affordable ultrasound devices and trained professionals.
2. **Infrastructure Limitations:** Poor power supply and internet availability.
3. **Skill Barriers:** Frontline health workers are often untrained in ultrasound interpretation.
4. **Data Limitations:** Models must function on **image-only inputs** without additional sensors or metadata.

Thus, a system is needed that can:

* Analyze **pre-recorded ultrasound videos or images**
* Operate **completely offline**
* Guide **non-experts**
* Provide **automated diagnostic metrics** with high accuracy

## 💡 **Proposed Solution: Natalis**

**Natalis** is an **Android-based AI tool** designed to interpret ultrasound images and videos without internet access. It provides **automated obstetric assessments** for low-resource environments using deep learning models.

### **Core Features**

1. **Offline AI Inference** – Runs entirely on-device without internet connectivity.
2. **Video and Image Analysis** – Supports both ultrasound image sets and short sweep videos.
3. **Multi-Task Diagnostic Pipeline:**

   * **Gestational Age (GA) Estimation:** Calculates fetal biometric parameters (head circumference, femur length, abdominal circumference) with ±1–2 weeks accuracy.
   * **Fetal Presentation Detection:** Determines orientation (cephalic/breech).
   * **Placental Location Identification:** Segments placenta to detect anterior/posterior positioning or low-lying placenta.
   * **Fetus Counting:** Identifies multiple gestations (twins, triplets) via fetal skull detection.
4. **Clear Visual Interface:** Summarized report with icons, colored risk flags, multilingual support, and minimal technical text.

## 🔬 **Methodology**

### **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**

* Datasets sourced from **open fetal ultrasound repositories** and partner clinics.
* Focus on **second-trimester** scans (14–28 weeks) for clear fetal anatomy.
* **Preprocessing pipeline:**

  * Extract frames from videos.
  * Resize (e.g., 256×256), normalize brightness/contrast.
  * Apply data augmentation (rotation, flipping, noise).
  * Filter out low-quality or irrelevant frames.

### **2. Model Architecture**

Multiple deep learning models are trained for specialized diagnostic functions:

| Task                     | Model            | Objective                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard Plane Selection | **ResNet (CNN)** | Identify relevant frames (head, abdomen, femur)    |
| Biometric Measurement    | **U-Net**        | Segment fetal structures for geometric measurement |
| Orientation & Counting   | **YOLOv5**       | Detect fetal skulls and classify cephalic/breech   |
| Placenta Segmentation    | **Custom U-Net** | Identify placental tissue and flag abnormalities   |

Models are trained using **supervised learning** with **GPU acceleration (NVIDIA RTX)** and **transfer learning** for faster convergence.
All models are converted to **TensorFlow Lite** or **PyTorch Mobile** for Android deployment.

## 🧱 **System Architecture**

### **High-Level Workflow**

1. **Input:** Pre-recorded ultrasound image/video from device storage.
2. **AI Engine:**

   * Frame extraction and preprocessing.
   * Sequential inference using CNN, U-Net, YOLOv5 pipelines.
3. **Computation:**

   * Fetal biometry → GA calculation.
   * Object detection → presentation & count.
   * Segmentation → placenta mapping.
4. **Output Dashboard:**

   * Displays GA, fetal position, placental location, fetus count.
   * Alerts for anomalies (e.g., “Possible placenta previa”).
   * Saves key frames for record keeping.
